# Progysis - Program Analysis framework for Java

Progysis is a general purpose framework that can be used to specify and run analyses on programs written in any programming language.

Progysis implements the general Abstract Worklist Algorithms for program analysis, which allows the users to implement analyses with minimal theoritical fuss. By using the Progysis, users only have to implement the parts of the analysis that are specific to their use case and let Progysis handle the actual running of the analysis.
